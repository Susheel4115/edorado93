Spring has sprung in South Lake Union! Donâ€™t miss the spring SLU&YOU letters on the Nitro Plaza and beautiful chalk art by the Day 1 Playfield and Van Vorst Plaza. And of course, it wouldnâ€™t feel like spring without cherry blossoms, tulips, magnolias, daffodils, and more. Check out @southlakeunion to discover more to love in the SLU neighborhood this season. #SLUinBloom #SLUxYOU
