Today is #EarthDay! What better way to celebrate than spending time in one of Seattle's many urban parks and green spaces. Check out the link in our bio for a list of parks and trails that highlight the beauty of the Emerald City and Pacific Northwest. 🌎 💚

Pro Tip: Getting outdoors is more than something Seattleites do on Earth Day, it's part of our everyday culture! Explore Seattle like a local by visiting its parks throughout the year.
